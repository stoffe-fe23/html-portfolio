          <h2>Web</h2>
          <p>I have been involved in creating a number of smaller web sites for various of organisations.</p>
          <p>
            I mostly focused on the <strong>back-end</strong> functionality, such as creating simple custom booking and reservation systems, event registration systems and
            information databases. I have also created visual themes for the CMS used by the sites.
          </p>
          <p>I worked with the Drupal CMS as a base, using PHP, MySQL and MariaDB as building blocks.</p>

          <img src="images/icon-translate.png" alt="Translate symbol" class="info-image" />
          <h2>Translation</h2>
          <p>
            I have worked translating texts of different kinds and lengths from Swedish into English, or vice versa. Mostly, but not only, for use on web sites. This work also
            included proof-reading texts.
          </p>
          <p>The most complex translation work I have been involved in is translating the 360 pages book <em>"Vikingakungens guldskatt"</em> by Sven Rosborn into English.</p>

          <h2>Games</h2>
          <p>There is more to a creative life than just work.</p>
          <p>
            I have always enjoyed spending my relaxation time playing computer games. Many games I play also tend to tickle my creative itch, inspiring me to create mods for them
            to better suit my personal tastes or add things I found missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have created numerous game mods over the years, as well as a few modding tools and utilities when such were not available. Most for my own use, but a few released
            into the wild.

              <p>
                Defining the layout and design of the web, CSS has allowed web pages to come a long way from their humble beginning as plain text with simple formatting to complete
                user interfaces.

              <p>
                Growing the web page from a mere document with structured information into a full fledged application, Javascript is a core component for making your page do
                whatever you want.

                Being able to store, retrieve and process data on the server side is useful when building web applications. As such I know my way around the PHP scripting language

              <p>Digging through the depths of the Archive folder on my hard drive I came across an old screenshot of the first serious website I worked on.</p>
              <p>
                The site was made for a startup online recruiting service called <em>Jobado</em>, operating out of SoftCenter in Ronneby just next to the university college campus.
                I worked there during the summer vacation of 2000 along with three other fellow BTH students to develop their website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jobado did not last long as it went bankrupt during the massive IT bubble crash in 2001 like so many other fledgling IT companies. But at least this memory remains.

              <p>
                My parents visited and brought their dog Benji with them. The very cute border collie quickly found himself at home on my couch, even though this was his first
                visit to my place.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fancying himself something of a couch connoisseur Benji tends to try out the seating furniture of anyone he visits. Being cute and charming, and knowing it, he gets
                away with it too, mostly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adopted from a dog shelter with an unknown but seemingly troubled past it is nice to see the timid dog regain some measure of self confidence and find himself at
                home in his new family.
